Tutorial
========
PySim is a python extension that enables the user to create
simulations based on differential equations.

The differential equations are modelled as systems. Each system
contains *states* and their time-derivatives, *ders*. It can
contain parameters, *pars*,to be set by the users. The pars can 
only be set before the simulation is started, while *inputs* can
be set at each timestep. The *inputs* can also be connected to
to *outputs*. *Inputs* and *outputs* are  non-state variables
that can be used to connect systems during a simulation. It is
possible to store the *inputs*, *outputs* and *states* during the
simulation and look at the results afterwards.

Installing PySim
----------------
PySim will soon be installable using pip. There will be wheels for
the Windows and Mac OS that are pre-compiled and ready to use by
typing

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pysim

These wheels are built using the standard numpy wheel at pypi. If you
want to use another version of numpy, e.g. the excelent one from
`Christoph Gohlke's collection <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_
you will have to compile pysim yourself.

There are no wheel packages for linux, but it should still be installable by pip
if you have the correct requisites (c++ build capability and the boost libraries).

Using PySim
-----------
To setup a simulation import a Sim object from the Simulation
package. Then add the system that should be simulated, set any
parameters, decide what variables or states that should be stored
during the simulation, and then run the simulation. After it is
finished the results can be inspected using for example matplotlib.

.. code-block:: python

    from pysim.simulation import Sim
    from pysim.systems import VanDerPol
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    #Create a Simulation
    sim = Sim()

    #Create, set up and add a system to simulation
    sys = VanDerPol()
    sys.store("x")
    sim.add_system(sys)

    #Simulate and plot the results
    sim.simulate(20,0.1)
    x = sys.res.x
    plt.plot(x)
    plt.show()

These commands will result in a plot like:

.. image:: /images/VanDerPolPlot.png
